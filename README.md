## About
The last YouTube app that supports Android 6-7 is **17.34.36**.  
However, the latest ReVanced/RVX Patches doesn't support YouTube 17.34.36.

By using this fork, you can patch YouTube 17.34.36 and you can use YouTube ReVanced on Android 6 or 7.

This fork is based on the latest RVX Patches, and I added minimal changes to support 17.34.36.

## üì£ Announcement of major update
In January 2025, the biggest update was released!  
Since then, this fork is **based on the latest RVX Patches.**

Previously, this patch was based on RVX v2.160.1 (released in Feb 13, 2023).  
v2.160.1 was the last version that works on 17.34.36.
But it was too old and has less features than now.  
For example, the current RVX Patches contains a lot of new features that should also be available in 17.34.36, but this fork didn't have such features.  
So I moved to latest version of RVX Patches and added only minimal changes for 17.34.36.

**Almost all RVX features are available now!**  
And it will always follow the RVX's update!  
I keep the diff commits clean, so I will be able to follow the RVX updates easily by rebase my commits.
