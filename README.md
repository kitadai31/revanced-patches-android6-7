# YouTube ReVanced for Android 6.0-7.1
ReVanced Extended fork for YouTube 17.34.36. (unofficial)  
Based on inotia00's ReVanced Extended (RVX) [v2.160.1](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/releases/tag/v2.160.1)

## üì£ Announcement about current development status
I'm currently working on remaking this fork based on the latest RVX.

Currently, "YouTube ReVanced for Android 6-7" is based on RVX Patches v2.160.1 and with some additional features.  
As a result, new features were unavailable and old bugs were still present.

After this is completed, ‚ÄúYouTube ReVanced for Android 6-7‚Äù is based on the latest RVX Patches and it contains minimal changes to support 17.34.36.  
Almost all RVX features will be available.
It will always follow the RVX's update.

Currently, 70% of the work has been completed.

## About
The last YouTube app available on Android 6 or 7 is **17.34.36**.

And ReVanced Extended **v2.160.1** was the last patch compatible with 17.34.36.

So I decided to fork RVX v2.160.1 to support YouTube 17.34.36.  
I fixed some issues for 17.34.36 and backported some features (**including endless buffering fix**) from newer RVX Patches.

Also, I released a fork ReVanced Manager for Android 5-7.

## About YouTube Music
This fork doesn't have patches for YT Music.

For YT Music, use inotia00's official RVX Patches.  
It supports old YT Music versions for Android 5.0-7.1.  
(YT Music `v6.20.51` for Android 5-6, `v6.42.55` for Android 7.x)

See [About YouTube Music](https://github.com/kitadai31/revanced-patches-android6-7/wiki/About-YouTube-Music)

# Warning: Do not use this on Android 8.0+!

Sometimes I see people trying to use this fork on newer Androids believing that YouTube 17.34.36 has better performance.  
However, this is incorrect.  
This patch is based on the old code base of RVX and is poorly optimized. (Especially the ad filter and network stack of SponsorBlock & RYD.)  
This means that this fork may have potential performance issues.

Therefore, I do not recommend using this on Android 8.0 or above devices.

I also see people using this fork to get old UI design, but this is also wrong.

## Recommended ways:

### For performance:

- Patch the official RVX Patches to YouTube `18.29.38`

18.29.38 is the oldest version supported by the inotia00's official RVX Patches.  
This is a sufficiently old version, and is expected to have same performance as 17.34.36.

> If you are using RVX Manager, to select a 18.29.38 apk, turn off the "Require suggested app version" setting.

### For old UI:

- Patch YouTube `18.29.38`, and set "Spoof app version" setting to `17.33.42`

YouTube app UI is server-side, so you can get the old design by spoofing app version, without using the actual old versions.  
17.33.42 is the oldest working version and has the same design as 17.34.36.

This way, you get both the old design and the stability of the latest patches.

> Tip: Follow this [instructions](https://github.com/kitadai31/revanced-patches-android6-7/wiki/Spoof-app-version-information#-how-to-reflect-version-spoofing-immediately) to reflect version spoofing.
